"""
Function to plot ApRES data

Parameters
----------
fn : str
    Filename to plot, including complete path from current folder. If no filename given, a file-browser window is displayed.
bl : list, optional
    List of bursts to plot, starting at burst 0. Default is -1, which means plot all bursts. Each burst is plotted in a different figure window.
cl : list, optional
    List of chirps within bursts to plot, starting at chirp 0. Default is -1, which means plot all chirps. Chirps from within each burst are either averaged (default) or, if plot option "c" is selected, overplotted.
md : int or float, optional
    Maximum depth to plot in meters. Default is 2000.
po : str, optional
    String containing all or none of 'c','a','r','t'. Default is 'a'.
    'c': plot individual chirps (if absent, plot mean of chirps)
    'a': plot depth profiles, averaged unless "c" included as a plot option. If no other options, "a" is assumed by default.
    'r': plot raw bursts as time series
    't': plot chirp time series, averaged unless "c" included as a plot option

Returns

None

     Processing depends on what has been requested. This program supports
     the following plot options:
        "r" Raw (full burst as a time series)
        "t" Average of the chirps selected from the burst, as a time series
        "a" Amplitude plot (return power vs range) from the averaged chirp
        "c" Do not average chirps in each burst
